10	MUSTARD GLAZED BAKED HAM AND PIMENTO CHEESE BISCUITS	Bobby Flay's made-from-scratch buttermilk biscuits help take his sandwich to new, buttery heights.

19	AVOCADO, ROAST TURKEY AND BACON	Tyler roasts his own turkey for this ultimate turkey sandwich, but if short on time you could use deli meat.

27	MEDITERRANEAN SALMON SANDWICH	Two tips to make this salmon sandwich extraordinary: It's best if you make the salmon filling ahead of time to really let the flavors combine, and use an herbed Italian bread for extra flavor if you can find a loaf.
